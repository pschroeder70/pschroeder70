- 👋 Hi, I’m @pschroeder70 aka Pete Schroeder
  
- 👀 I’m interested in home automation, networking (linux/windows), front end development (html/css/js) & movie collecting (4k, bluray)
- 🌱 I’m currently learning network/server stuff, Home Assistant (painful)
- 💞️ This is my sandbox, partial projects, things in the works, playing with new stuff...
- 📫 How to reach me here and there, linkedIn, email, irc (kidding stopped using that when the bot invasion happened)
