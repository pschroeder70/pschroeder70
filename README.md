- 👋 Hi, I’m @pschroeder70 aka Pete Schroeder, I am a front-end developer (html/css/js)
- 💞️ This is my sandbox, partial projects, things in the works, playing with new stuff...
- 👀 I’m interested in home automation, networking (linux/windows/pi) & movie collecting (4k, bluray)
- 🌱 I’m currently learning network/server stuff, Home Assistant (painful)
- 📫 How to reach me here and there, linkedIn, email, irc (kidding stopped using that when the bot invasion happened)
